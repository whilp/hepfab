hep-fab: Fabric for UW-HEP
==========================

hep-fab captures common system administration tasks performed by the `High Energy
Physics`_ group at the `University of Wisconsin`_ in a `Fabric`_ fabfile. By
automating these typically manual tasks, this project makes it easier to manage
an ever-growing cluster. While some of the specific tasks in this project are
site-specific, many of the techniques and, hopefully, much of the code may be
successfully reused elsewhere.

Basic Usage
+++++++++++

Commands are defined in :module:`hepfab.commands`. To see the available
commands, use the :option:`--list` option::
    
    $ fab --list

Commands can be run on individual hosts, lists of hosts or groups of hosts
identified by a role. You can select the hosts you wish to run on via the
command line; see Fabric's usage message and :ref:`roles` for more information.

.. _roles:

Roles
+++++

Fabric commands can be targeted to groups of hosts, called *roles*. The fabfile defines
a number of roles using the :func:`hepfab.util.genrange` convenience function.
To use one of the defined roles, specify it on the command line. The following
command will run :command:`w` on all of the hosts in the 'servers' role.
    
    $ fab -R servers -- w

To add new roles, update the :data:`fab.env.roledefs` dictionary.
