hep-fab: Fabric for UW-HEP
==========================

hep-fab captures common system administration tasks performed by the `High Energy
Physics`_ group at the `University of Wisconsin`_ in a `Fabric`_ fabfile. By
automating these typically manual tasks, this project makes it easier to manage
an ever-growing cluster. While some of the specific tasks in this project are
site-specific, many of the techniques and, hopefully, much of the code may be
successfully reused elsewhere.
